# Lab 04: Enabling Continuous Integration with Azure Pipelines
# Student lab manual

## Lab overview

In this lab, you will learn how to configure continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) for your applications using Build and Release in Azure Pipelines. This scriptable CI/CD system is both web-based and cross-platform, while also providing a modern interface for visualizing sophisticated workflows. Although we wonâ€™t demonstrate all of the cross-platform possibilities in this lab, it is important to point out that you can also build for iOS, Android, Java (using Ant, Maven, or Gradle) and Linux.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a basic build pipeline from a template
-   Track and review a build
-   Invoke a continuous integration build

 **Exercise 1: Include build validation as part of a Pull Request**
 
 In this exercise, you will include build validation to validate a Pull Request.
 
 **Task 1: Import the YAML build definition**
 
 In this task, you will import the YAML build definition that will be used as a Branch Policy to validate the pull requests.
 
 Let's start by importing the build pipeline named **eshoponweb-ci-pr.yml**.
 
   1. Go to **Pipelines(1)>Pipelines(2)**. Click on **Create Pipeline(3)** or **New Pipeline** button.

      ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/5bd60911-3cb8-48f5-8d70-169d3191ee17)   

   2. Select **Azure Repos Git (YAML)**

       The build definition consists of the following tasks:
      
         o **DotNet Restore:** With NuGet Package Restore you can install all your project's dependency without having to store them in source                   control. 
        
         o **DotNet Build:** Builds a project and all of its dependencies.
        
         o **DotNet Test:** .Net test driver used to execute unit tests.
        
         o **DotNet Publish:** Publishes the application and its dependencies to a folder for deployment to a hosting system. In this case, it's                 **Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory**.

**Exercise 2: Configure CI Pipeline as Code with YAML**

  In this exercise, you will configure CI Pipeline as code with YAML.

**Task 1: Import the YAML build definition**

  In this task, you will add the YAML build definition that will be used to implement the Continuous Integration.

  Let's start by importing the CI pipeline named **eshoponweb-ci.yml**.

  1. Go to **Pipelines>Pipelines(1)** and click on **New Pipeline(2)** button

     ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/268df693-0604-47e8-9b34-6e9cdfda4e17)

  2. Select **Azure Repos Git (YAML)**

      ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/da618915-df41-4523-91a1-24bbbf505eb5)

  3. Select the **eShopOnWeb** repository

     ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/22afdccf-4ea1-4f93-9a31-6b59aa607d97)

  4. Select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File**

     ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/61f93510-e853-4c27-a282-17ecca69ffa9)

  5. Select the **/.ado/eshoponweb-ci.yml(1)** file then click on **Continue(2)**

     ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/9b5c7e10-875f-477d-b8a9-7126b1aea7b0)

     The CI definition consists of the following tasks:
     
   o **DotNet Restore:** With NuGet Package Restore you can install all your project's dependency without having to store them in source control.
       
   o **DotNet Build:** Builds a project and all of its dependencies.
       
   o **DotNet Test:** .Net test driver used to execute unit tests.
       
   o **DotNet Publish:** Publishes the application and its dependencies to a folder for deployment to a hosting system. In this case, it's             **Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory**.
       
   o **Publish Artifact - Website:** Publish the app artifact (created in the previous step) and make it available as a pipeline artifact.
       
   o **Publish Artifact - Bicep:** Publish the infrastructure artifact (Bicep file) and make it available as a pipeline artifact.
       
              
   **Task 2: Enable Continuous Integration**
   
   The default build pipeline definition doesn't enable Continuous Integration
   
   1. Now, you need to replace the **trigger: none** code with the following code:
   
      ```
        trigger:
        branches:
          include:
          - main
        paths:
          include:
          - src/web/*
      ``` 
   
      ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/7a44b1d7-578d-4468-9331-d0857fabdf80)
   
      ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/2b6ded54-6d9c-427b-b516-fefe3631ba8a)

      This will automatically trigger the build pipeline if any change is made to the main branch and the web application code (the src/web folder).Since you enabled Branch Policies, you need to pass by a Pull Request in order to update your code. 
    
  2. Click the **Dropdown** and **Save(2)** button (not **Save and run**) to save the pipeline definition.

     ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/0f563873-ac78-438b-865a-46bf8d880b95)
  
  3. Select **Create a new branch for this commit(1)** Keep the default branch name and **Start a pull request(2)** checked. and Click on **Save(3)**

     ![image](https://github.com/prathimavalasapally/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/assets/127385764/d10c6eb2-38b6-4415-8ec8-82bc3f96e695)

  4. Your pipeline will take a name based on the project name. Let's **rename** it for identifying the pipeline better. Go to                          **Pipelines>Pipelines** and click on the recently created pipeline. Click on the **ellipsis(1)** and **Rename/Remove** option. Name it            **eshoponweb-ci(2)**   and click on **Save(3)**.
