# Lab 01: Controlling Deployments using Release Gates

## Lab overview

This lab covers the configuration of the deployment gates and details how to use them to control the execution of Azure Pipelines. To illustrate their implementation, you'll configure a release definition with two environments for an Azure Web App. You'll deploy to the Canary environment only when there are no blocking bugs for the app and mark the Canary environment complete only when there are no active alerts in Application Insights of Azure Monitor.

A release pipeline specifies the end-to-end release process for an application to be deployed across various environments. Deployments to each environment are fully automated by using jobs and tasks. Ideally, you don't want new updates to the applications to be simultaneously exposed to all the users. It's a best practice to expose updates in a phased manner, that is, expose them to a subset of users, monitor their usage, and expose them to other users based on the experience of the initial set of users.

Approvals and gates enable you to take control over the start and completion of the deployments in a release. You can wait for users to approve or reject deployments with approvals manually. Using release gates, you can specify application health criteria to be met before the release is promoted to the following environment. Before or after any environment deployment, all the specified gates are automatically evaluated until they pass or reach your defined timeout period and fail.

Gates can be added to an environment in the release definition from the pre-deployment conditions or the post-deployment conditions panel. Multiple gates can be added to the environment conditions to ensure all the inputs are successful for the release.

As an example:

- Pre-deployment gates ensure no active issues in the work item or problem management system before deploying a build to an environment.
- Post-deployment gates ensure no incidents from the app's monitoring or incident management system after being deployed before promoting the release to the following environment.

There are 4 types of gates included by default in every account.

- Invoke Azure Function: Trigger the execution of an Azure Function and ensures a successful completion.
- Query Azure Monitor alerts: Observe the configured Azure Monitor alert rules for active alerts.
- Invoke REST API: Make a call to a REST API and continues if it returns a successful response.
- Query work items: Ensure the number of matching work items returned from a query is within a threshold.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure release pipelines.

# Exercise 5: Test release gates

In this exercise, you will test the release gates by updating the application, which will trigger a deployment.

## Task 1: Update and deploy application after adding release gates

In this task, you will first generate some alerts for the Canary Web App, followed by tracking the release process with the release gates enabled.

1. From the Azure Portal, browse to the **Canary Web App** Resource deployed earlier.
1. From the Overview pane, notice the **URL** field showing the Hyperlink of the web application. Click this link, which redirects you to the EShopOnWeb web application in the browser.

1. To simulate a **Failed Request**, add **/discount** to the URL, which will result in an error message, since that page does not exist. Refresh this page several times to generate multiple events.
1. From the Azure Portal, in the "Search resources, services and docs" field, enter **resource group(1)** and select the **Resource group(2)** Resource created in the previous exercise.

1. There should be at least **1** new alert in the list of results, having a **Severity 2** enter **Alerts** to open the Alerts Service of Azure Monitor.
1. Notice there should be at least **1** Failed_Alert** with **Severity 2 - Warning** showing up in the list. This got trigger when you validated the non-existing website URL address in the previous exercise.

    > **Note:** If no Alert shows up yet, wait another few minutes.

1. Return back to the Azure DevOps Portal, open the **eShopOnWeb*** Project. Navigate to **Pipelines**, select **Releases** and select the **New Release Pipeline**. Click the **Create Release** button.

1. On **create a new realease** page, click on **Create**.

1. Wait for the Release pipeline to kick off, and **approve** the Canary Stage release action.
1. Wait for the Canary release Stage to complete successfully. Notice how the **Post-deployment Gates** is switching to an **Evaluation Gates** status.  Click the **Evaluation Gates** icon.

1. For the **Query Azure Monitor Alerts**, notice an initial failed state.
1. Let the Release pipeline in a pending state for the next 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes did pass, notice the 2nd evaluation failing again.
1. This is expected behavior, since there is an Application Insights Alerts triggered for the Canary Web App.

    > **Note**: Since there is an alert triggered by the exception, **Query Azure Monitor** gate will fail. This, in turn, will prevent deployment to the **Production** environment.

1. Wait another 3 minutes and validate the status of the Release Gates again. As it is now +8 minutes after the initial Release Gates got checked, and it's been more than 8 minutes since the initial Application Insight Alert got triggered with action "Fired", it should result in a successful Release Gate, having allowed the deployment of the Production Release Stage as well.
